Question1

Supervised learning accurately predict future response by giving the model observed output and input. Unsupervised machine learning to analyze unlabeled datasets with no response.

The major difference between them is that unsupervised machine learning model learn without a supervisorï¼Œbecause unsupervised learning model does need to discover hidden patterns itself. the supervised learning is created to measure its accuracy.

from lecture slides page #31-34

```{r setup, include=T}




knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```


```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
